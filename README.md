# Pegasus Blog

##Usage
###How to use in your WordPress site

Ideally you could go to the github repo and click download, but since the zip file name is not correct when you save it we recommend you implement the plugin in one of these two ways instead:

1.) In the terminal:
Use 
####https://
<code>git clone https://github.com/Visionquest-Development/pegasus-blog.git pegasus-blog</code>
Or
####SSH
<code>git clone git@github.com:Visionquest-Development/pegasus-blog.git pegasus-blog</code>

2.) Upload via FTP/WordPress Admin
Download zip file from [[https://github.com/Visionquest-Development/pegasus-blog/archive/master.zip]] and on extraction make sure the folder name you extract to is saved as pegasus-blog instead of pegasus-blog-master
Then upload to you server using an FTP program or Use the WordPress Plugin Upload feature in the WordPress Admin.
